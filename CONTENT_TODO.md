# Content TODO

Things in scenario files that are unverified, or representative rather than
copied verbatim from official docs. Every scenario's *behavior* claims (what a
command does, why the fix works) are sourced; the items below are mostly exact
*output formatting* that the docs don't print. Check them against a real run
from your own experience and tick them off.

## linux/full-disk
- [ ] `df -h` header row and column layout: df(1) (coreutils 9.11) doesn't print a sample.
- [ ] `du -sh` and `ls -lh` output layout: representative.
- [ ] `OSError: [Errno 28] No space left on device`: the Python docs describe
      errno/strerror but don't show the str() format.
- [ ] logrotate with `missingok` and a glob that matches nothing: logrotate(8)
      documents missingok for a *missing log file*. Confirm it's also silent for
      a non-matching glob (the debrief relies on the documented wording only).
- [ ] `: > file`: Bash docs confirm output redirection truncates an existing file;
      `:` as the null command is standard but not quoted here.

## networking/dns-resolution-failure
- [ ] `dig +short` timeout text `;; connection timed out; no servers could be reached`:
      the BIND 9 dig manual documents exit code 9 ("No reply from server") but not
      this exact message, which differs between BIND versions.
- [ ] `ping -c 3` output (iputils format): representative.
- [ ] `curl: (6) Could not resolve host: <name>`: the libcurl docs confirm error 6
      and its meaning; the exact CLI prefix format is representative.
- [ ] Ansible INI inventory: group syntax matches the docs. Whether `#` comments are
      allowed isn't stated there, so the scenario avoids them.

## containers/crashloopbackoff
- [ ] `kubectl get pods` RESTARTS column `6 (82s ago)`: the docs' example shows a bare count.
- [ ] `kubectl describe pod` `Environment:` line `<set to the key 'url' in secret 'orders-db'>`: representative.
- [ ] `kubectl top pods` output: representative.
- [ ] `kubectl rollout history` with `<none>` change-cause: representative.

## iac/terraform-state-lock
- [ ] The `Error acquiring the state lock` block (box-drawing borders, Lock Info
      fields, closing paragraph) isn't printed in the HashiCorp docs.
      The behavior (lock blocks the run, force-unlock takes the lock ID, docs warn
      against -lock=false) is sourced.
- [ ] `aws s3 ls` output layout and the `terraform.tfstate.tflock` object name: the
      S3 backend docs confirm the `.tflock` suffix.
- [ ] GitHub Actions cancelled-step message `Error: The operation was canceled.`: representative.
- [ ] terraform plan output formatting: representative.

## cicd/failing-github-actions
- [ ] npm ci error lines (`npm error code EUSAGE`, the "can only install packages
      when your package.json and package-lock.json ... are in sync" sentence, the
      `Invalid: lock file's ...` line): npm docs confirm the behavior ("npm ci will
      exit with an error") but don't print the message.
- [ ] setup-node log lines and `Error: Process completed with exit code 1.`: representative.
- [ ] `gh run list` column layout: representative.

## microservices/cascading-failure
- [ ] All traces, metrics and logs are synthetic: realistic shapes built from the
      SRE book's and Azure Circuit Breaker pattern's descriptions, not copied from
      a real system.
- [ ] Amazon Builders' Library "Timeouts, retries and backoff with jitter" would be a
      good extra source, but the page is now JavaScript-rendered and couldn't be fetched.

## cloud/aws-single-az-database
- [ ] AWS Health Dashboard event wording: representative, modeled on typical AZ
      connectivity events rather than copied from a specific one.
- [ ] `aws rds describe-db-instances` JSON: field names match the RDS API
      reference (AvailabilityZone, MultiAZ, ReadReplica*); the trimmed layout
      (with `...`) is ours.
- [ ] ALB target-health and app log lines: representative.

## cloud/azure-appgw-health-probe
- [ ] `az network application-gateway show-backend-health` JSON: the health
      states and the "Status code of the backend's HTTP response didn't match
      the probe setting. Expected:... Received:..." message are from Microsoft's
      docs; the lowercase JSON field names and structure are representative.
- [ ] `az network application-gateway probe show` JSON: representative.

## cloud/gcp-cloud-run-connection-exhaustion
- [ ] PostgreSQL `FATAL:  sorry, too many clients already` wording, wrapped by
      psycopg2/SQLAlchemy: widely seen but not quoted from the PostgreSQL docs here.
- [ ] `gcloud run services describe` and `gcloud sql instances describe` output:
      representative.
- [ ] `--max` flag: taken from the current Cloud Run docs (older docs and
      scripts use `--max-instances`).

## cloud-design (design challenges, all three)
- [ ] Cost units are illustrative by design (PLAN_DESIGN_CHALLENGES.md §2). Check
      that the relative ordering feels right to you.
- [ ] Hidden capabilities (`scales`, `survives`) are judgment calls, not doc
      facts. For example: Front Door caching absorbs a 20× static-page spike
      (`scales: 20`), and Application Gateway doesn't (`scales: 1`). Review these
      against your experience.

## cloud-design/aws-checkout-az-resilience
- [ ] "Every instance launches in the one Availability Zone you gave the group"
      is inferred from how Auto Scaling groups use subnets; not quoted.

## cloud-design/azure-tv-ad-marketing-site
- [ ] Standard plan facts are from "Reliability in Azure App Service" (fault
      domains; nonzonal plans can go down in a zone outage). Cost of Standard vs.
      Premium v3 is illustrative.

## cloud-design/gcp-launch-day-signups
- [ ] "About 60 Cloud Run instances at peak" and the 500-connection limit are
      scenario numbers, not Google figures.

## cloud-design/aws-checkout-canvas (canvas, not playable until C3)
- [ ] Web server capacity (2× normal traffic each) is a scenario number.
- [ ] The engine's model: a `sync` link = automatic failover with no lost
      writes; an `async` link = manual promotion, possible lost writes. That
      matches RDS Multi-AZ vs. read replicas (sourced), but it's a simplification
      for other databases.
- [ ] Apps reaching the database "through its endpoint" (so a traffic link to
      the primary also reaches its sync standby after failover) models the RDS
      DNS switch described in the failover docs.
